# PrescriptionScreen_iOS
This screen, built using Xcode's Storyboard interface, implements a searchable table view to display a list of prescriptions. Users can leverage the integrated search bar to quickly filter and locate specific entries. Selecting a prescription navigates to a detailed view, where users can choose an item. Upon selection, the corresponding image for that item is displayed.
